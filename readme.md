The map created is of Campgrounds in North Cascades National Park Service Complex. This map provides information about where campgrounds are located in North Cascades National Park. This map would be useful to any visitors that are camping or are visiting that want to camp in the park. There are symbols to symbolize the campgrounds located on the map. The data was received from the U.S. Department of Interior. A shapefile was downloaded from the National Park Service website. A legend was created to show what the map is showing so it is easy for map viewers to understand what they are looking at. The map was created using Atom and creating an html file. A scale bar was added the map as well so map viewers can see the distance in between differing campground locations. The basemap was taken from Carto. It is shaded light so you are able to see the points on the map.
